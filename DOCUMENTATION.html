      <h1>SMART CRADLE</h1>
      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        A smart cradle is a type of baby cradle that integrates technology to
        enhance the safety, comfort, and convenience of both the baby and the
        parent. This innovative product has gained significant attention and
        popularity in recent years, with many parents embracing the idea of
        using technology to assist in the care of their babies.The concept of a
        smart cradle was introduced as a solution to common challenges that
        parents face when caring for newborns. These challenges include
        sleepless nights, crying babies, and the constant monitoring of the
        baby's condition. In conclusion, smart cradles are an innovative and
        practical solution for parents who want to take advantage of technology
        to enhance their baby's safety and comfort. With features such as motion
        sensors, temperature control, music and sound, and monitoring and alert
        systems, smart cradles provide a host of benefits for both the baby and
        the parent. While it's important to remember that no technology can
        replace the watchful eye and attentive care of a parent or caregiver,
        smart cradles can be an invaluable tool to help parents care for their
        babies more effectively and efficiently.

      <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As we are very well familiar with the hurdles faced by Parents to
        nurture their infant and especially in case if both the Parents are
        working. To give 24 hours of time in such cases is next to impossible.
        However they still need to look after their babies, thereby increasing
        workload and stress. They either send their babies to their parents or
        hire a baby caregiver while they are working. Some parents worry about
        the safety of their babies in the care of others. Thus they go home to
        check on their babies during their free time, such as lunch or tea break
        . A baby Monitoring System that can monitor the babies' condition real
        time is proposed to solve these problems. A baby monitoring System
        consisting of a camera and microphone without limitations of coverage.
        The proposed solution involves live monitoring of the child. Sound
        Sensor for the detection of the child's crying activity. When detect
        crying, plays a song and starts swinging. The Thermal sensor notifies
        the parent about the environmental temperature near the baby and switch
        on the fan automatically according to the temperature. Thus, we need to
        develop something unique that can help Parents to have a continuous
        watch on the Baby and can notify about the same. Thus, we have come up
        with an idea to design a standalone application I e., Cradle System,
        which will help the Parents to monitor their child even if they are busy
        for particular time & detect every activity of the baby. This system
        considers all the minute details required for the care & protection of
        the Baby in the cradle. The baby monitoring system is attached to the
        cradle so that an incubator kind of environment will be created for the
        baby. The design of smartness & innovation comes with the use of
        technologies/methodologies which include Modules like Raspberry Pi,
        Arduino, moisture & Temperature sensing, Swing Automation, Cry Detecting
        Mechanism, servo motors, etc. each sensors has their own functionality
        ,these sensors are connected to the endpoints like Arduino . The data
        generated by the sensors is given to the processing unit, the processing
        unit acts up on the r espective information received , so that the
        values which were generated by the endpoints can be monitored by the
        serial monitor. If the recorded readings show any abnormalities, the
        necessary actions like controlling temperature, switching on or off the
        fan, setting up cradle's movement, playing music for the baby will be
        taken. The baby monitoring system prototype helps the parents in time
        management and makes it easier for the caretakers as well. This baby
        monitoring system is proven to have less harm for the baby with the most
        accuracy. This monitoring system is a highly efficient for real time
        monitoring with the best security measures.it is very useful for busy
        people. What will happen if we use IOT: cry detection mechanism which
        detects cry of the baby and send instant mobile app notifications to
        theuser Turn on and off functions of the mini fan can be fully controled
        using the mobile application also according to the need of the user.
        Swing of the cradle is fully controlled by the Mobile application , a
        cloud server is maintained to store database and send notifictions .
